Hi! My name is Yanzhi Wang. You can call me Puttin if you wish.

I'm an experienced iOS App developer. I'v been developing iOS Apps since early 2013. I love Swift and I love cool Apps. I love command-line utilities and I love automation.

In Life, I have two cats and I love them. In my spare time, I like to listen music and play games. You can find my IDs below.

Please feel free to contact me.
